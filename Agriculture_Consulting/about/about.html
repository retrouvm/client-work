            <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem; color: var(--agri-emerald);">Protecting Accra's Last Remaining Forest</p>
            
            <div class="content-paragraph">
                <p>For approximately 14 years, Dr. Brenya Twumasi has been at the forefront of efforts to protect Achimota Forest. This work has involved countless hours of advocacy, including writing to Presidents, land commissioners, courts, and media outlets. The fight continues as the forest faces ongoing threats from development and illegal encroachment.</p>
                
                <p>As Dr. Twumasi emphasizes: "It's not about Achimota—it is rather the last forest that was present in Accra is close to extinction. We as humans were tasked to Tend the Gardens. We begun Advocacy in Earnest 12 years ago - some of us have a long-standing Agricultural background. We saw this as vital. Many were shortsighted despite our efforts."</p>
                
                <p>The documentary work and advocacy surrounding Achimota Forest represents a critical component of Ghana's national development conversation, addressing environmental issues, illegal encroachment, politics, and the urgent need for environmental protection.</p>
