        <h2>Brenya Twumasi</h2>
        <p class="consultant-intro">Award-Winning Entrepreneur and AI Expert</p>
        <p>My professional journey merges the realms of law, psychology, and criminal justice. I work simultaneously across these three fields at all times, bringing a unique cross-disciplinary perspective to Artificial Intelligence consulting.</p>
        
        <p>Having studied Artificial Intelligence for decades, I am honored to be a facilitator of learning and have empowered communities to better their comprehension of Artificial Intelligence. I am the owner of <strong>C4C: AI Institute</strong> and <strong>Songai Institute</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>In 1998, I founded <strong>Tactical Ops</strong>, a company that helps organizations create culturally diverse and inclusive workplaces. We evaluate pre-existing programs and provide resources such as workshops and train-the-trainer classes, while tracking the progress of these programs.</p>

            <div class="content-paragraph">
                <p>AI infrastructure encompasses the complete ecosystem of hardware, software, and networking components required to develop, train, deploy, and maintain artificial intelligence systems. This infrastructure extends beyond traditional computing resources to include specialized accelerators, distributed computing frameworks, and data management systems. The architecture must balance performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness while supporting both research and production AI workloads.</p>
                
                <p>Key considerations in AI infrastructure design include computational capacity for training complex models, storage systems capable of handling large datasets, and networking infrastructure that enables efficient data transfer and distributed computing. Organizations must also consider factors such as energy efficiency, given the significant power consumption of AI workloads, and the ability to scale infrastructure dynamically as AI initiatives grow. Modern AI infrastructure often leverages hybrid approaches, combining on-premises resources with cloud-based services to optimize for different stages of the AI lifecycle, from initial experimentation to large-scale production deployment.</p>
